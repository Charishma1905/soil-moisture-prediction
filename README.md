"Machine learning model to predict soil moisture using Linear Regression"

#  Project Overview
This project predicts soil moisture using machine learning.  
Phase 1 implements *Linear Regression* to analyze the relationship between temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

# Dataset
- File: soil_moisture.csv
- Features:  Temperature,  Humidity
- Target:  Soil Moisture
  
#Phase 1 
– Linear Regression
- Trained a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluated using Mean Squared Error & R² Score.
- Visualized Actual vs Predicted soil moisture.

  Phase 2: Advanced Modeling & Insights

In Phase 2, the project was extended beyond the simple Linear Regression model (Phase 1) to include advanced machine learning techniques and a more lifecycle-oriented approach.

#Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook   
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 
 #Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Normalized features using StandardScaler
Train-test split (80/20)

2. Models Trained
Linear Regression (baseline)
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor

3. Evaluation Metrics
R² Score → goodness of fit
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

# Results
- Linear Regression gives a *baseline model* for soil moisture prediction.

Phase 1: Baseline Model Development

Objective: Establish a simple predictive pipeline for soil moisture using basic environmental features.

Data Preparation:

Used a simulated dataset with Temperature (Â°C) and Humidity (%).

Preprocessed and split data into training and testing sets (80/20).

Modeling Approach:

Implemented Linear Regression as the baseline model.

Trained and evaluated the model to check feasibility of prediction.

Evaluation:

Metrics used: RÂ² Score, RMSE, MAE.

Achieved moderate accuracy, showing soil moisture can be predicted but with limited precision.

Key Output:

Proof-of-concept that environmental factors (temp & humidity) can be used for soil moisture prediction.

Established the foundation for more advanced models in Phase 2.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Advanced Modeling & Insights

Objective: Improve prediction accuracy by expanding the dataset and applying advanced ML algorithms, while aligning with sustainable agriculture practices.

Dataset Expansion:

Added Rainfall (mm) as an additional feature.

Normalized features using StandardScaler for consistent training.

Modeling Approach:

Trained and compared three models:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Used the same train/test split for fair comparison.

Evaluation:

Compared using RÂ² Score, RMSE, MAE.

Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost significantly outperformed Linear Regression.

Visualizations:

Soil Moisture vs Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall.

Predicted vs Actual values for each model.

Impact Assessment:

Applied an irrigation threshold: if soil moisture < 30%, irrigation is required.

Best-performing model correctly identified irrigation needs with ~XX% accuracy (replace with your result).

Demonstrates potential for water conservation in smart farming.

Lifecycle Alignment:

âœ… Data Collection & Preprocessing

âœ… Advanced ML Modeling

âœ… Model Evaluation & Visualization

âœ… Early Impact Assessment

Key Output:

Identified XGBoost/Random Forest as the most reliable models.

Delivered insights that connect prediction accuracy with real-world water-saving benefits, paving the way for Phase 3 (sensor integration and deployment).

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Real Sensor Integration & Deployment (Future Work)

Objective: Connect real-world hardware sensors with the trained ML model to enable live soil moisture prediction and automated irrigation decisions.

Sensor Hardware Setup:

Use Soil Moisture Sensors (Capacitive/Resistive) for direct soil readings.

Integrate DHT11/DHT22 sensors for temperature and humidity.

Optionally include Rain Gauge / API weather data for rainfall input.

Microcontroller: Arduino / ESP32 / Raspberry Pi to collect and transmit data.

Data Flow:

Sensors â†’ Microcontroller â†’ Data Transmission (via Wi-Fi/Serial) â†’ Python Backend.

Pretrained ML model predicts soil moisture level and irrigation requirement.

Deployment Approach:

Develop a dashboard/web app to display live soil readings and predictions.

Implement threshold-based alerts: e.g., if soil moisture < 30%, send irrigation notification.

Optional automation: trigger relay module to control a water pump for smart irrigation.

Impact & Sustainability:

Ensures real-time decision-making for farmers.

Reduces over-irrigation and water waste.

Moves project from simulation â†’ real-world IoT application.

Future Enhancements:

Cloud storage of sensor data for long-term trend analysis.

Mobile app integration for farmer-friendly use.

Integration with solar-powered systems for sustainable deployment.
